# AI-Powered-Code-Editors-Revolutionizing-Bug-Detection-and-Correction
### Contributions of the Project:
Enhanced Bug Detection and Fixing
Streamlined Development Workflow

### Objectives:
Develop an AI-driven code editor that can automatically detect and fix coding issues.

### Outcomes:
A robust AI-assisted code editor capable of identifying and rectifying various types of coding errors.

### Assumptions:
Availability of a accurately labeled dataset for training the deep neural network model.
Proper data splitting into training, validation, and possibly testing sets for model training and evaluation.

### Experimental Setupimage

 ## STEPS
 
### Prepare data
##### Convert the data samples into numerical sequences using Tokenizer
##### Assign unique integer index to each unique word
##### Convert text into sequence of integers
##### Sequence are padded to have same length
### Create model, compile, train, prediction
##### Choosing activation function, optimizer, loss function, evaluation metrics.
##### Splitting the data for training
##### Predict
